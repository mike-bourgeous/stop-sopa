# STOP SOPA

This repository is an overlay version of zachstronaut's STOP SOPA page for the [January 18 blackout to protest SOPA](http://sopastrike.com/).

You can copy the contents of the provided **`index.html`** into your site's homepage on January 18 as one possible way to participate.

Changes from the original:

 * Reduced the text box from full-page
 * Made the background transparent
 * Added the ability to close/open the overlay, so the site can still be used
